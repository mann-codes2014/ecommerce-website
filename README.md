This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

 I am developing this App while following this [JavaScript Mastery tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mOkFXyxfsU&list=PL6QREj8te1P7gixBDSU8JLvQndTEEX3c3&index=7&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery).
In order to challenge myself, I will not follow exactly same path as the original course author. Please see extensions
## Extensions

3. Styled Components
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
